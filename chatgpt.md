The metaprop R package is a tool for conducting meta-analyses in the R statistical computing language. It provides functions for importing, cleaning, and organizing data from individual studies, as well as for carrying out a variety of common meta-analytic methods, including fixed- and random-effects models, subgroup analyses, and funnel plots. To use the metaprop package, you will first need to install and load it in R, as shown below:

Copy code
# Install the package from CRAN
install.packages("metaprop")

# Load the package
library(metaprop)
Once the package is loaded, you can use its functions to conduct your meta-analysis. For example, to import data from a set of individual studies, you can use the read_studies() function, which takes as its input a list of file paths pointing to the study data files. The read_studies() function returns a studies object, which is a special data structure used by the metaprop package to store and manipulate study data.

Copy code
# Read in the study data
studies <- read_studies(c("study1.csv", "study2.csv", "study3.csv"))
Once you have your study data in a studies object, you can use other functions in the metaprop package to carry out your meta-analysis. For example, the meta_analysis() function can be used to fit a fixed- or random-effects model to the data, while the forest_plot() function can be used to visualize the results of the meta-analysis.

Copy code
# Fit a fixed-effects model
results <- meta_analysis(studies, model = "fixed")

# Visualize the results
forest_plot(results)
For more detailed information on using the metaprop package, including a full list of its functions and their arguments, you can refer to the package's documentation, which can be accessed by running the help() function in R and providing the package name as the input.

Copy code
# Access the package documentation
help(package = "metaprop")
